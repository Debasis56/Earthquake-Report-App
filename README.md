<h1>Earthquake Report App</h1>

## Project title - Earthquake-Report-App
An app with a clean UI which provides live updates and forecast of earthquakes occurring over the world. The app sends a customized query to the USGS data server API matching the userâ€™s preference, fetches live information and provides necessary information to the users. I have used Recycler View to store the list of information to save out the extra memory due to the overhead of loading all items at a time.
